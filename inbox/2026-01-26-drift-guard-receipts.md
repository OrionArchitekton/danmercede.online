claim: "Drift guard receipts are immutable records generated by the Drift Guard Service, logged via the Receipt Service, documenting configuration drift events and their remediation actions."
implication: "These receipts provide a verifiable and auditable history of configuration state changes and automated remediation, crucial for maintaining system integrity and compliance."

When discussing system integrity, the concept of "drift guard receipts" is fundamental. These are not a distinct service, but rather the immutable records produced through the interaction of the Drift Guard Service and the Receipt Service. They document configuration drift events and any subsequent remediation actions.

The Drift Guard Service is responsible for continuously monitoring deployed resources. Its primary function is to compare the current state of these resources against their desired configuration. When a deviation, or "drift," is detected, the Drift Guard Service initiates a workflow. This workflow logs the drift event and can trigger alerts or automated remediation based on predefined policies. The service ensures that deployed infrastructure adheres to its defined configurations, preventing unauthorized changes.

The Receipt Service plays a crucial role in this process. It manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of receipts for all transactions within the system. Receipts are immutable records of operations, providing an immutable ledger for all system operations. This ensures auditability and non-repudiation. Every significant operation, including configuration changes and drift remediation, generates one of these immutable receipts.

Therefore, a "drift guard receipt" is the immutable record generated when the Drift Guard Service detects configuration drift or performs a remediation action, with this record being managed and stored by the Receipt Service. While the term isn't explicitly defined as a standalone component, its function is clearly established through the combined operations of these two core services. This mechanism ensures a complete and verifiable history of how infrastructure state is maintained and corrected.
