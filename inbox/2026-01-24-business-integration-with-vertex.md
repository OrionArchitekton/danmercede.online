Vertex AI is a managed machine learning platform, central to our architecture for training and deploying ML models. It is a core service, handling the entire ML model lifecycle management. This includes model training, deployment, and ongoing management.

From a business perspective, Vertex AI enables the integration of advanced analytics and predictive modeling. It is leveraged for machine learning capabilities, supporting business logic and rules within our workflows. The platform's design includes integration points and frameworks, facilitating its connection with other services. This allows for the incorporation of machine learning outputs into operational processes, from data ingestion through model inference.

While the artifacts establish Vertex AI's role in supporting business logic and its integration capabilities, specific details on the strategies or mechanisms for "business integration" beyond its function as an ML platform are not explicitly detailed. Its primary function is to provide the ML backbone that can then be integrated into broader business systems.
