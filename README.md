# danmercede.online

Living signal surface.

This repository hosts the source for **danmercede.online**, a public working log used to publish short-form notes, experiments, and status updates related to systems architecture, governance, execution, and failure modes.

---

## Purpose

This site exists to surface **work-in-progress thinking**.

It is intentionally:
- Not polished
- Not canonical
- Not comprehensive

Posts represent provisional ideas, experiments, and operational observations shared in real time.

---

## Content Types

The site publishes the following entry types:

- **Short Essay** — focused analysis of a single idea
- **Experiment Log** — hypothesis, constraint, result, next step
- **Status Update** — operational changes and incidents
- **Thought Snippet** — brief signal extraction
- **Working Note** — incomplete reasoning or open questions

Each post is timestamped and tagged. No retroactive editing.
